In the language of  first-order logic, I provide in  this post a proof
in natural deduction which translates the argument that Descartes gave
in the Third Meditation as evidence of the existence of God. 
</p>
<div id="outline-container-introduction" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="introduction"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
I am  going to  focus only on  the logical  structure of
Descartes&rsquo;s argument  <a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">[1]</a>, to prove that  this argument
is, from a deductive point of view, <i>intuitionistically valid</i>. Let us
recall these important definitions: 
</p>

<div class="defi">
<p>
An argument  is <i>deductively valid</i> if  and only if its  conclusion is
true whenever its premises are all true. <a href="#citeproc_bib_item_2">[2, p. 17]</a>
</p>

</div>
<div class="defi">
<p>
An  argument is  <i>sound</i>  if and  only  if  it is  valid  and all  its
premises are true. <a href="#citeproc_bib_item_2">[2, p. 18]</a>
</p>

</div>

<p>
Therefore, the validity  and the soundness of  Descartes&rsquo;s argument are
different issues, and there  are sometimes confused, for
example, by  Williams when he wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The trouble  with Descartes’s system is  not that it is  circular; nor
that there is an illegitimate relation between the proofs of God and the
clear and distinct perceptions; nor that there is a special problem
about the proofs of God when they are not intuited. I have argued
that in these respects, it is structurally sound. The trouble is that
the proofs of God are invalid and do not convince even when they
are supposedly being intuited.<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_3">[3, p. 195]</a>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<i>Pace</i>  Williams,  I am  going  to  prove  in first-order  logic  that
Descartes&rsquo;s argument  is <i>valid</i>, that  is <i>deductively valid</i>.  To do
this, I need the following formal lexicon: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>c</i> = &ldquo;the <i>cogito</i>&rdquo;,</li>
<li><i>d</i> = &ldquo;the idea of God&rdquo;,</li>
<li>\(x \geqslant y\) = &ldquo;the degree of  reality of <i>x</i> is at least equal
to that of <i>y</i>&rdquo;,</li>
<li><i>Sxy</i> = &ldquo;the formal reality <i>x</i>  is the total and efficient cause of
the  objective reality  <i>y</i>&rdquo; (the  meaning of  &ldquo;formal reality&rdquo;  and
&ldquo;objective reality&rdquo; are explained below),</li>
<li><i>Rcy</i> = &ldquo;<i>y</i> is a thought of the <i>cogito</i>&rdquo;,</li>
<li>Last, to the usual rules of natural deduction for first-order logic,
I  add  this  couple  of   rules  derived  from  the  definition  of
\(\geqslant\),  where   <i>defm.</i>  and  <i>defs.</i>  are  the  respective
abbreviations for the <i>definiens</i> and  the <i>definiendum</i> that are at
the bottom of each rule:</li>
</ul>
\begin{array}[tb]{ccc}
\dfrac{x \geqslant y}{(x > y) \lor (x = y)}\scriptsize{\geqslant defs.}& & \dfrac{ (x > y) \lor (x = y)}{x \geqslant y}\scriptsize{\geqslant defm.} \\
\end{array}

<p>
The core of the first proof of the existence of God in the
<i>Third Meditation</i> is contained in the following text: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
And so there  remains only the idea  of God, in which  I must consider
whether there  is anything that could  not derive from myself.  By the
name   ‘God’  I   understand   an   inﬁnite,  independent,   supremely
intelligent,  supremely  powerful substance,  by  which  I myself  and
whatever else  exists (if anything  else does exist) was  created. But
certainly, all  these properties are  such that, the more  carefully I
consider them,  the less it  seems possible  that they can  be derived
from me alone. And so I must conclude that it necessarily follows from
all that has been said up to  now that God exists. For indeed, even if
the idea of substance is in me as  a result of the very fact that I am
a substance, the  idea of an inﬁnite substance would  not therefore be
in me, since I am ﬁnite, unless it derived from some substance that is
really inﬁnite.<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">[1, p. 32]</a>  
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Descartes&rsquo;s  argument  is  the  deduction   of  a  conjunction  of  two
statements, deduction which can therefore  be divided into two subproofs. To
use  Descartes&rsquo;s  vocabulary,  the   last  sentence  in  the  previous
quotation means  that the objective  reality of the idea  of substance
can  be caused  by  the formal  reality of  the  <i>cogito</i> because  the
<i>cogito</i> is  a substance, but  being a finite substance,  the <i>cogito</i>
cannot be the cause of his  idea of God, because the objective reality
of this idea is an infinite substance, <i>and</i> only a formal reality of an
infinite substance  can be  the cause of  this representation.  On
this  point, Williams&rsquo;s  explanations  are the  clearest  I have  ever
read:  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
He  calls  the  reality  that anything  possesses  intrinsically,  its
<i>formal</i> reality; and  he calls the reality that an  idea possesses in
virtue of its object, its <i>objective</i> reality. Thus all ideas have the
same  degree of  formal reality,  but different  degrees of  objective
reality – because their objects have, or would have, different degrees
of  (formal) reality.  Lastly, in  expressing the  principle that  the
cause of anything must contain at least as much reality as the effect,
he says that the reality of the  effect must exist in the cause either
<i>formally</i>  or  <i>eminently</i>: <i>formally</i>,  if  there  is just  as  much
reality in  the cause as in  the effect, and <i>eminently</i>,  if there is
more reality in the cause than in  the effect, the cause being of some
higher type than  the effect (this will  be so with works  of art, the
mind of the artist  being of a higher type of reality  than any of his
products).  Putting all  these terms  together, Descartes’s  principle
about the  causation of ideas  comes out like  this: the cause  of any
idea must contain either formally or  eminently as much reality as the
idea           possesses          both           formally          and
objectively.<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_3">[3, p. 125]</a> 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In its simplest expression, the conclusion of Descartes&rsquo;s argument says
that the cogito is not the cause of  the idea of ​​God <i>and</i> that there is
something which is the  cause of this idea and which  is as perfect as
this idea of ​​God, conjunction that can be translated by
</p>

\begin{equation}
\label{one}
\lnot Scd \land \exists x(Sxd \land (x = d))
\end{equation}

<p>
There will be therefore a first subproof  to deduce the formula on the left
of conjunction \eqref{one} that is
</p>
\begin{equation}
\label{two}
\lnot Scd
\end{equation}
<p>
and the  second subproof will be  the deduction of the  formula on the
right of conjunction \eqref{one}. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-first_subproof" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="first_subproof"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> First Subproof</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Three premises are  needed to deduce \eqref{two}.  The  first of them
is the definition of the idea of God: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The  idea of  God is  &ldquo;the  idea of  a supremely  perfect and  inﬁnite
being.&rdquo;  <a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">[1, p. 33]</a>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Descartes&rsquo;s point  is that the  representative content of the  idea of
God is  such that it is  impossible for the <i>cogito</i>  to get the
intellection  of  a  perfection   that  would  be  greater.  Therefore,
the formalization of  <a href="anselms_argument_in_first-order_logic.html">Anselm&rsquo;s definition of God</a> can be  used again to
translate Descartes&rsquo;s claim: 
</p>
\begin{equation}
\label{three}
\forall y \lnot(y > d)
\end{equation}
<p>
the idea  of God is the  idea of the  being that is such  that nothing
greater can be thought of. 
</p>

<p>
Contrarily to  the idea of God,  I can always conceive  something more
perfect than  I am.   Therefore, expressed at  the first  personn, our
second premise would say &ldquo;I have certainly not all the perfections that
I  conceive in  the idea  of  God&rdquo; and,  in our  lexicon, this  second
premise  says &ldquo;it  is  false  that the  degree  of  perfection of  the
<i>cogito</i> is the same as the degree of perfection of the idea of God&rdquo;: 
</p>

\begin{equation}
\label{four}
\lnot(c = d)
\end{equation}

<div class="rema">
<p>
Some readers  will find  maybe useful the  following explanation  on a
part of the first subproof.  Note that from \eqref{three} and \eqref{four}
it is possible to deduce 
\(\lnot(c \geqslant d)\):
\[
\forall y \lnot(y > d),\lnot(c = d) \vdash \lnot(c \geqslant d)
\]
</p>

<div class="proof">

<p>
and,  once  erased  all   the  discharged  assumptions,  the  previous
deduction is reducible to the following  deduction that is going to be
a <i>part</i> of the first subproof: 
</p>
\begin{prooftree}

<div class="rema">
<p>
Note that the sequent
\[
\lnot(c > d), \lnot(c = d) \vdash \lnot((c > d) \lor (c = d))
\]
has just been proved above; it is an instance of De Morgan&rsquo;s laws that
is intuitionistically derivable  (hence the label <i>DMi</i>).   It is also
well known that this other instance of De Morgan Law: 
\[
\lnot((c > d) \land (c = d)) \vdash \lnot(c > d) \lor \lnot (c = d)
\]
is  <i>not</i>  intuitionistically  valid,  but  valid  only  in  classical
logic; such a deduction does not exist in  Descartes&rsquo;s argument. 
</p>

</div>

<p>
Finally,  a specific  application  of the causality principle is
necessary for Descartes&rsquo; argument, as clearly shown by what he wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Now, it is manifest  by the natural light that there  must be at least
as much reality in the total and  efficient cause as in its effect. For,
I ask, from where could the effect  derive its reality, if not from the
cause? And  how could the  cause give it reality,  if it did  not also
possess it? Hence it follows, both that nothing can come from nothing,
and that  what is more  perfect (that  is, what contains  more reality
within itself)  cannot derive from what  is less perfect. And  this is
not only  plainly true  of those  effects whose  reality is  actual or
formal, but  also of  ideas, in  which only  the objective  reality is
considered. <a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">[1, p. 29]</a> 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I call &ldquo;principle of applied  causality&rdquo; this application of causality
principle from formal realities  to objective realities that represent
them: &ldquo;A formal  reality <i>x</i> is the cause of  an objective reality <i>y</i>
only if the degree  of perfection of <i>x</i> is at least  equal to that of
<i>y</i>,&rdquo; which I translate by: 
</p>
\begin{equation}
\label{five}
\forall x \forall y(Sxy \to x \geqslant y)
\end{equation}

<p>
Formula \eqref{five} provides the  third and last premise necessary  to get
the first step of Descartes&rsquo;s argument that concludes that the <i>cogito</i>
is not the cause of the idea of God. Indeed, formula \eqref{two}
is  deducible  from  the   conjunction  of  \eqref{three},  \eqref{four}  and
\eqref{five}:
</p>

\begin{equation}
\label{six}
\forall y \lnot(y > d), \lnot(c = d), \forall x \forall y(Sxy \to x \geqslant y) \vdash \lnot  Scd

<p>
The second  step of Descartes&rsquo;s  argument must  prove that there  is a
cause of the  idea of God and  that this formal reality  of this cause
has necessarily the  same perfection as the objective  reality of this
idea, in  other words,  that this  cause is God.   In the  language of
first-order logic with our lexicon, the second subproof of Descartes&rsquo;s
argument must be the deduction of the following formula which is on the
right of conjunction \eqref{one}: 
</p>

\begin{equation}
\label{seven}
\exists x(Sxd \land (x = d))
\end{equation}

<p>
The deduction of  \(\exists x(Sxd)\) is not difficult and is based on
two premises only;  &ldquo;Every idea that the <i>cogito</i> thinks  has a cause&rdquo;
for the first, and  &ldquo;The idea of God is thought  by the <i>cogito</i>&rdquo; for
the second, respectively: 
</p>
\begin{equation}
\label{eight}
\forall y(Rcy \to \exists x Sxy)
\end{equation}
<p>
and 
</p>
\begin{equation}
\label{nine}
Rcd
\end{equation}

<p>
It is now quite easy to deduce \(\exists x(Sxd)\) from \eqref{eight} and
\eqref{nine}:

\end{prooftree}

<p>
From this  result, it  is now possible  to deduce  \eqref{seven} without
additional premise, but  it needs more work.  Here is  the second part
of the proof that shows that sequent \eqref{ten} is valid: 
</p>
\begin{equation}
\label{ten}
\forall y(Rcy \to \exists x Sxy), Rcd, \forall x \forall y(Sxy \to x \geqslant y), \forall y \lnot(y > d) \vdash \exists x(Sxd \land (x = d))

It is now  trivial to deduce \eqref{one} from  the conjunction of
the proofs of \eqref{six} and \eqref{ten}: 
</p>

\begin{equation}
\label{eleven}
\forall y \lnot(y > d),\lnot(c = d), \forall x \forall y(Sxy \to x \geqslant y), \forall y(Rcy \to \exists x Sxy), Rcd \vdash \lnot Scd \land \exists x(Sxd \land (x = d))

<p>
From  the  respective  proofs  of sequents  \eqref{six}  and  \eqref{ten},
\eqref{eleven}  is proved  by  application of  the  rule of  conjunction

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Three points to conclude. First, this analysis
of Descartes&rsquo;s argument provides a logical result that is in agreement
with  Vuillemin&rsquo;s  point  of   view  according  to  which  Descartes&rsquo;s
philosophical            system           is            intuitionistic
<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_4">[4]</a>, <a href="#citeproc_bib_item_5">[5]</a>.  Indeed, note that, by contrast with
Anselm&rsquo;s, Descartes&rsquo;s  does not need any  specifically classical rule,
nor existence predicate.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Second,  once  this  argument  is  faithfully  formalized  in  natural
deduction,  becomes   transparent  a  logical  relation   between  two
principles  which, according  to  Gueroult, are  basic in  Descartes&rsquo;s
theory of truth:  the principle of correspondence of  true ideas with
the  objects  represented   by  these  ideas,  and   the  principle  of
causality. Gueroult wrote: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Without the principle  of causality, it would be impossible  for me to
attain  the   existence  of   God.  Without   the  principle   of  the
correspondence  of  the  idea  with  what  is  ideated,  it  would  be
impossible to  demonstrate that  my idea  of God is  the image  of his
being and allows me to know him,  since to prove that something is the
effect  of something  else  is  not sufficient  to  establish that  it
resembles it. <a href="#citeproc_bib_item_6">[6, p. 119]</a> 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
He added later:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The principle of the conformity of  the idea with what is ideated only
affirms a  resemblance between two  terms; the principle  of causality
affirms an equation -<i>ad minimum</i>- between two terms. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And he concluded: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The quantity of perfection contained in an idea cannot be evaluated by
its resemblance  to the  thing, since this  resemblance is  unknown <i>a
priori</i>,      and       must,      on      the       contrary,      be
established.<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_6">[6, p. 133]</a> 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The proof above  shows that the resemblance that is  the equality of
perfection between the idea of God and God is logically deduced from
the  principle  of causality  and,  moreover,  that such  a  resemblance
between an  idea and &ldquo;what  is ideated&rdquo; can  be deduced only  in the
case of the idea of God. 
</p>

<p>
Third, the result of this logical  analysis now leads me to a single
question: Descartes&rsquo;s argument being deductively  valid, is it sound, I
mean, are  these five premises  all true? For  the sake of  brevity, I
reserve an answer to this question for another publication.
